Flask API for User Login and Signup and MySQL db.

This repository provides a simple and secure API for user login and signup using Flask and MySQL It allows users to register with their name, email, and password, and then authenticate using those credentials. 
The code uses Bcrypt for secure password hashing and verification, ensuring user data protection. 

I have used Postman to handle api requests.

Use sqldb.sql file to create database and table to store credentials of users.
